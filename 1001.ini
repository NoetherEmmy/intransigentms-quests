Info=Psst. Hey.\r\n\r\nYou.\r\n\r\nCome over here. You look... kinda tough, I guess. Look, I need some help. I've given out a loan to someone I can't extract the debt from -- some giant, ugly fuckin' slug by the name of #rMano#k.\r\n\r\nI want to repossess his stuff to make the debt even, but I don't think he or any of his cronies would take very kindly to me treading on their territory. So I was wondering if you could... #eahem#n subdue him, you know. Soften him up for me. It's going to be dangerous, but I can reward you handsomely.
