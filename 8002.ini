Info=#esigh#n\r\n\r\nI've been giving out gold pieces and trinkets for New Year's for... god knows how many new years.\r\n\r\nAs of late I've been... a bit more attached, you might say, to the pieces that I find than is usual. I've been taking them with me everywhere -- and I mean everywhere. My pockets are heavy and my palms are sweaty with the weight of these\r\n\r\n\t\t#edelicious#n\r\n\r\ngolden pieces of light. So much so that they're not really... "golden pieces of light" anymore. In fact, I'm not so sure they've got much value anymore. I sure don't think anyone will want them when they see them.\r\n\r\nProblem is, there's only so much gold around. I don't just pull the stuff out of thin air, you know, the way I try to make it appear. I need some good chunks, seeing as New Year's is so soon.\r\n\r\nDo you think you could get me #b2 Golden Ancient Shields#k and #b3 Golden Moles#k for me? I have a giant bird to give you in return, if you like.
