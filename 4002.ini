Info=Well. Now that we've filled up your belly with all of that food, it's time to excercise the mind and soul.\r\n\r\nThis training will consist of two things:\r\n\r\n(1) You will go and get #b4 Mind & Heart Medicines#k from a #bTae Roon#k.\r\n(2) You will talk to #bSamuel#k, who is right here next to me, and pass his #rquiz#k in order to get a #bFire Raccoon Eraser#k from him.\r\n\r\nOnly if you bring me these two items will I know that you have completed your mental training.
