Info=#epssssst#n\r\n\r\nHey. Kid.\r\n\r\nI need your help. You see, I realize that I'm here with all these big bad professor elf magic-people, but that's not really my jam. I actually don't know anything about fighting or magic or anything like that. I'm just here because I know a guy.\r\n\r\nBut I was able to get some of the low-down on this magicky shit. Only problem now is, I need a bunch of that #bDark Crystal Ore#k to make myself more powerful. In fact, if my calculations are correct, I need exactly #b31 of 'em#k.\r\n\r\nBut I just can't let\r\n\r\n#elooks around nervously#n\r\n\r\nthese guys see me getting 'em. So... maybe you could help me out?
