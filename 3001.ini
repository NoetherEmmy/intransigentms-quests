Info=Welcome back. Thank you so much, again, for killing those baddy-bad time-guys down there in Ludibrium. We really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThere was, umm, one important thing that I #emay#n have left out when I sent you on that first mission. Uh, you see, the time-guys down there weren't actually... doing any training of humans or anything. I kind of, lied, I guess, about that part. Uhm.\r\n\r\n#esigh#n\r\n\r\nReally, we just wanted their armlets so we could harvest the powers that they have and use it to make ourselves more powerful. I know, sounds selfish.\r\n\r\nBut hey, don't they have, like, a saying in your language? Goes something like... "You can't make an armlet without breaking a few eggs."\r\n\r\nSomething like that. Anyways, we need to make this armlet, so we need you to collect for us #b100 Egg Shells#k, #b90 Broken Horns#k, and kill for us #b130 Skelosaura#k and #b150 Red Dragon Turtles#k.
