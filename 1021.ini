Info=#esigh#n\r\n\r\nI... apologize for the terrible flute pun. I just hate being stuck out here...\r\n\r\n#escans surroundings and leans in to whisper#n\r\n\r\n(...with this Wayne guy. Real piece of work.)\r\n\r\n(Really, all I want to do is make some music; in any case, it might drown out some of the noise coming out of Wayne's mouth over here.)\r\n\r\n#emakes slight head jerking gesture towards Wayne#n\r\n\r\n(I used to play the flute, you know. Pretty well, too.)\r\n\r\n(That's... what I was hoping you could help me with.\r\nYou see, I don't have anything to make a flute out of, and this entire town only sells full-sized god damn organs, with the whole wedding thing and all.)\r\n\r\n(So... I was wondering if you could get some bones for me so I can bone up on playing the boneflute. And maybe even a harp so that Wayne over here has something to play instead of running his mouth all day.)\r\n\r\n(All I really need is #b120 of Hankie's Pan Flutes#k, and for you to #bkill 80 Harps#k for Wayne's sake.)
