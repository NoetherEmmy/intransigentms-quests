Info=Alright, kid. So you wanna summon monsters and constructs to fight for you?\r\n\r\nWell tough shit. You don't know the first thing about constructs. Do you even know what that word means? I doubt it.\r\n\r\nLook, if you wanna summon sweet-ass golems and octopoes 'n' shit like me, you're gonna have to slay a few constructs yourself so you can know how they work. You know, what they're made of, what makes 'em tick.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm sending out out to gather for me #b80 Yellow Toy Blocks#k, #b80 Blue Toy Blocks#k, #b80 Destroyed Nests#k, #b80 Stone Golem Rubbles#k, #b80 Dark Stone Golem Rubbles#k, and #b80 Mixed Blocks#k.
