Info=Well, I guess there's at least a silver lining to the whole nuclear facility debacle. Some of the #bBlins#k out east of here have started transforming... into strange, broom-producing creatures.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't have a Ph. D in biology, but I get the feeling that this is kind of a rare thing. I'd like you to go out there and get me #b100 Brooms#k from the Blins, to be safe. This place needs a lot of sweeping.
