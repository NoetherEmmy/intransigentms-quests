Info=I suppose this is the day I regret moving my business here. It's been frigid the entire time I've been here, but I've never truly frozen my ass off.\r\n\r\nAt least, until now. Winter's come upon us, and quite frankly I'm astonished at your own choice of attire -- aren't you bloody cold? Anyways, that's not what I'm here to ask you. I need your help.\r\n\r\nIf you can bring here to me #b40 Leatty Furballs#k and #b40 Dark Leatty Furballs#k so I can make myself some even warmer clothing, I can reward you.
