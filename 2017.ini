Info=Hey, um, sorry about this, but, I might have steered you a #elittle#n wrongly last time we met.\r\n\r\nYou see, when I told you to go out there and get rid of all of those Mummydogs it might have been a teensy bit over the line. The unfortunate consequence is that #rKing Commander Cartilage of Keratin Keep#k is now a little pissed... I heard he plans to crash Perion.\r\n\r\nThat can't happen. We need to crash Keratin Keep before they can even get started, or Perion is going to be a couple rock-dust piles and a couple of fuckin' bone people.\r\n\r\nYou're going to need to kill #b60 Commander Skeletons#k and #b60 Officer Skeletons#k, and bring back #b30 Horse Skulls#k so we have something to scare 'em away with.
