Info=Hello there! If you don't mind, I could use a bit of help.\r\n\r\nYou see, here in New Leaf City we pride ourselves on fiscal responsibility. As I hope you'll notice, the city is well planned, and when we have debts we pay them back.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to some... unforeseen circumstances, we are running a bit short on funds to pay back a certain creditor. Luckily we have a backup plan. Our historians and scientists have located a very valuable ancient relic here in New Leaf City -- unfortunately by the time we found out its location we had already built the city on top of it.\r\n\r\nThis is where you come in. I need at least #b35 boomer cores#k, which you can get from fighting the #bboomers#k around here, in order to excavate this relic using controlled explosions. If you can bring me those 35 cores, I have payment ready for you.
