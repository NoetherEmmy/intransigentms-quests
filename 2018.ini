Info=Did you hear about the nearby nuclear leak just east of here?\r\n\r\nI fuckin' told those assholes to quit with the nuclear scheming, nuclear power this, nuclear that...\r\n\r\nWell it got into one of the water supplies that the foxes in that forest normally drink. And I think it's had its effects. The foxes have grown #ethree tails#n, and they're getting markedly more aggressive.\r\n\r\nIn fact, just the other day Chil Nam had one of those fuckin' foxes crash into his rice paddy the other day and it stole half his harvest!\r\n\r\nI need you to get rid of this infestation. Go out and kill #b200 Samiho#k foxes so we can get rid of them once and for all.
