Info=Well, then. I do suppose you're that much closer to being a God, then, aren't you?\r\n\r\nLucky for you I've got just the thing if taking control over life and death is your thing.\r\n\r\nBut you'll need to prove yourself to me -- I don't just hand it out to no one; and in addition, you'll need to get yourself acquainted with the undead.\r\n\r\nGo out and fight for me #b274 Grim Phantom Watches#k and #b1 Griffey#k, and bring me back exactly #b2 Manon's Tails#k and #b1 Mouse#k from the #rPhysical Fitness Challenge#k. Mr. Oh can take you to that one.
