# Quest info as String 
Info=Jesus Christ, man. Have you heard? There's been another monsterous infestation down in the subway. #rTwo people died down there yesterday#k, man.\r\n\r\nChief says we need to kill 'em off if we want to be able to use the subway ever again -- but Victorian Pest Control is too busy over in #bNew Leaf City#k. Something about spiders that look like wolves? I don't know. Freaks me out, man.\r\n\r\nHey. What are you doing, anyways, walking around here with a weapon out and shit? Are you sure you're not here to kill the #dstirges#k and #dbubblings#k down there in the subway? I bet if you brought back #b32 Bubbling's Huge Bubbles#k and #b30 Stirge Wings#k, the chief would have a handsome reward for that.
