Info=Hey, kid. So, remember how last time I had you extract those um... #eingredients#n for me? Well, I hate to tell you this, but I don't actually make the stuff myself. I just distribute.\r\n\r\nProblem is, my usual nearby kitchen eggheads just got found out the other day. Whole operation was busted. But there's only one other place -- that I know of -- where I can get this made.\r\n\r\nThis is where you come in, again. I need you to transport the ingredients to a kitchen near the depths of Sleepywood.\r\n\r\nI'm warning you, though. #rThere will be treacherous guardians blocking your way#k, and you will have to kill them to get through. You can come to me when you are ready to begin the delivery.
