Info=Ok, well, we have quite a few leftovers from that huge feast we had for you.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we aren't exactly used to having a lot of this surplus perishable stuff. We need something to refrigerate the bulk of it.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm sending you, as part of your next training, to go out and slay #b123 Cold Sharks#k, #b153 Ice Drakes#k, and collect #b93 Frozen Shark's Fins#k and #b123 Ice Backbones#k.
