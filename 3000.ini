Info=Hello, my child. I've been watching your progress develop since you were but a wee naked blob on the face of Maple Island, whether you knew it or not.\r\n\r\nIt's apparent that you've become very powerful -- very quickly. So, now that you're all #ebig and bad#n, we'd like to ask you a favor.\r\n\r\nYou see, as you've probably noticed, here in Leafre we are a bit... low-tech. I mean, realistically, there's just not a whole lot of public infrastructure for transportation or anything like that, really. I mean, I'm lucky any time I get to ride in one of the wooden carts pulled by the tamed Kentauri, and they aren't a very quick breed on their hooves.\r\n\r\nBut we need to complete a task in Ludibrium nonetheless. Down in the depths of Ludibrium lie quite powerful monsters which have domain over the world of time. Normally this isn't a problem, but recently some of the leaders down there have started training adventurers like yourself in some... advanced chronological dark-arts. And we can't have that, I mean, we're supposed to be the ones with a monopoly on teaching humans weird tricks.\r\n\r\nSo if you could just go down there and kill #bThanatos#k and #bGatekeeper#k, and bring me back #r2 Thanatos' Straps#k and #r2 Gatekeeper Armbands#k to prove it, I could reward you with further training.
