Info=Hey, #h #!\r\n\r\n#esigh#n\r\n\r\nUgh, sorry. I can't give you any dermatological services today, if that's what you came here for. I ran out of one of my crucial ingredients -- #bDeer Horn Dust#k -- and without it, well, let's just say your skin won't look that much better. It's pretty expensive though...\r\n\r\nSay. You don't mind, maybe, going out there where the\r\n#bReindeer#k are and bringing me back #b60#k of their #bBroken Deer Horns#k, do you?
